# 3-Body-Problem
This repsitory gives a visual solution for the n-body problem with python module VPython.

# Visual example:
![3b_video](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/768b7ee5-22cd-4bce-9f31-32bf9ffec222)

# Requirements:
* Vpython
* Python 3.8 >

# Solver:

The differential equations where solved individually for every body with Euler's method

# Collisions:

The collisions where solved by inverting the component of the velocity going towards the other mass object and repositionsing the bodies at the right position.
